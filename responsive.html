				<p>If you live on planet earth, someone at some point has told you to learn to code. Whether you’re learning to code because you’re up for a big promotion at work, want an entirely new career, want to start freelancing on the side for extra cash or just want to learn something new for fun, picking up a few coding skills is really, really, REALLY good for you.

HTML is a great first place to start. But what’s next? With so much to learn, how can you confidently pick skills that will help get you where you want to go?

I get asked this question from beginner students all the time. Below, I’ve outlined skills that are useful across multiple career paths. They’ll give you a great start if you want to work as a full stack developer but are also applicable if you work in journalism, marketing, or project management, just to name a few fields, as these and other roles are becoming increasingly tech-heavy.
